#Create a class called BankAccount.
# It should have:

# A private attribute balance (start with 0).

# A method deposit(amount) to add money.

# A method withdraw(amount) to subtract money (only if enough balance).

# A method get_balance() to return the current balance.

# âœ… Hints: Use self.__balance to make balance private (Encapsulation).

# Create an object of BankAccount, deposit 100, withdraw 40, and print the balance.
